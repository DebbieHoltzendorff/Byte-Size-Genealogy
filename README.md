FamilySearch.org Family Tree Apps

May 2015 - Updates include several new apps and standardizing all the apps to have a progress bar, an execution timer, new  layouts, new FamilySearch app keys, add ARK links for the user, show output report in a new tab, a getUser lookup, and  notify user when there are no results.

April 2015 - I am a Church Service missionary working for FamilySearch's Lean Learning Team of the Family History Patron Services. I started programming JavaScript programs in April 2014 and am still a novice. My history with computers goes back to 1968 when I coded my first program on punched cards. Yes, we really used punched cards for each line of code and each line of data. And I was the only girl in the class.

Family history research can be a difficult endeavor and computers can make the searching easier. We are developing and testing various computer programs to make research faster. FamilySearch is encouraging all that are interested to use the FamilySearch APIs to build application products and services that help with family history. Please visit https://familysearch.org/developers/ and get started.

This is a repository of my team's work thus far. The programs are JavaScript applications which access the FamilySearch Family Tree APIs using the FamilySearch JavaScript SDK at https://github.com/rootsdev/familysearch-javascript-sdk. Please take a look. We are always looking for new ideas and coding experts.

Sincerely, Sister Debbie Holtzendorff
