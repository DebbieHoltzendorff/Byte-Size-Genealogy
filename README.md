FamilySearch.org Family Tree Apps

I am a Church Service missionary working for FamilySearch's Lean Learning Team of the Family History Patron Services.

Family History can be a difficult endeavor and computers can make the searching easier. We are developing and testing various computer programs to make Family History research faster.

This is a repository of our work thus far. The programs are JavaScript applications which access the Family Tree using the FamilySEarchJavaScript API. These tools are described at familysearch.org/developers/libraries.

We encourage all that are interested in learning more about Family Tree Development at familysearch.org/developers/.
